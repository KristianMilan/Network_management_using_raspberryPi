System Description : 
  The system implemented contains two major components :
  1. The Ubuntu Server :
      a)connection.sh 
      b)connection.py
      c)backup.sh
	  d) database.sql
  2. The RaspberryPi :
      a)send.sh
      b)files_ssh.sh
      c)iwlist.py
  3. The WebServer GUI
  
  Part 1: 
          Details :
          This folder contains files that are required on the server side.
		  All the files and dir in this folder needs to copied on the desktop
		  on the server.
		   i)	Connection.sh :- Main job of this script is to loop through all the files send by raspberrypi and for each file 
   			                     call 'connection.py' which will parse each file and enter the data into the database. Raspberrypi
			                     is configured to send all the files to '/home/cs5113/networks/files/' folder.
				
		   ii)	Connection.py :- This python file will parse the files send by raspberrypi and put it accordingly in database :
				
		   iii) backup.sh :- This script will take backup of database and everything from device_data table for management purpose
				
		   iv)	database.sql:- This sql file contains all database table and its schema. Pls import it into mysql
				
          Execution :
          The Connection.sh has to executed( with sudo privilege if 
          required). The script then internally call connection.py. For setting up backup.sh as cron job please refer to report_configuration.py
		  
  Part 2:
         Details :
         All the files in this folder are meant only for RaspberryPi and needs to copied on to the desktop
		 
          i)   send.sh :- This script generate an output file which is unique to reach Pi every 30sec. It contains device_id of Pi,
						  token no. of file to uniquely identify each file and its Ipv4 address and data of all the APs from which 
						  it is getting the signal in a nice tabular form. It then store them into 'files_to_send' folder.
          ii)  iwlist.py :- Main job of this file is to parse the output of 'iwlist scan' command in a more human readle format
							so that it is easier to parse it on the server side. This file gets called internally in send.sh
          iii) files_ssh.sh :- This file doesn't do anything special. Its main job is to copy whatever is there in 'files_to_send' dir
							   over to the server in a specific folder which is '/home/cs5113/networks/files/'.
          Execution :
          Both send.sh and files_ssh.sh needs to executed via root priviledges as background process to work smoothly
  Part 3:
        Web Server allows User to see the heat-map of desired area and 
		admin to allow modification of database or setting up new APs or 
		RaspberryPi.
